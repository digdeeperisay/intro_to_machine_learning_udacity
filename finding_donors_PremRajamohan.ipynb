    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "#### Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we are trying to model a binary outcome (1/0) and hence this is a classification problem. All the  models above might work work well for our problem but I felt the below three are good starting points!\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 1 - Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application: Decision trees are very popular in the real world because they can be constructed and interpreted easily. They can be used for several applications such as classifying a person as fit/unfit based on other parameters, classifying an email as spam/not, diagnosing a disease or not etc. They can also be used for regression problems where the outcome variable is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: As mentioned above, decision trees are easy to build and easy to interpret. They are also comprehensive and versatile in their application. They perform particularly well when there are complex interactions in your data which a linear model might not be able to capture effectively. It is also better when the number of outcomes classes are fairly small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Decision trees are error prone when there are too many classes and few examples to train the data on. It is also not the best choice when you are trying to predict a continuous outcome. The biggest weakness of a decision tree model is that it is prone to overfitting your data especially when the hyperparameters like depth, number of features for split etc. have not been set properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choice: Decision trees are a great choice for this model for the reasons outlined above. It is pretty easy to build, the outcome is binary, and I have a good understanding of how this model works overall. We have a lot of dummy features in our independent variables and running this through a decision tree model (with the right hyperparameters) will narrow down the significant features quickly.\n",
    "\n",

    "https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-classification-de64fc4d5aac\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2 - Ensemble Methods: AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application: Ensemble methods are a good choice simply because they are built from 'smaller' models and hence they are much more accurate than just taking the output from a single model. They can be used for all sorts of classification/regression problems and examples like recommender systems, health care diagnoses etc. come to mind. AdaBoost is a highly accurate classifier and seems like a good fit for our scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Crowd sourcing and diversity are good things even when it comes to modeling your data. Looking at multiple models/samples of your data tends to capture hidden relationships and provide a much higher accuracy overall. AdaBoost iteratively improves upon the errors made by prior models and hence misclassification is reduced as more iterations are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Any ensemble models including AdaBoost are computationally expensive to train and validate. They are also fairly complex to interpret and sometimes decision makers have a hard time buying into the model. They are not a good candidate where interpretability and time are big factors. AdaBoost is also susceptible to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choice: In this scenario, we are performing a classic binary prediction with a limited data volume, so we need not worry too much about the efficiency aspect. Using an ensemble model like AdaBoost here is likely going to provide a better accuracy than other options but we will find that out below!\n",

    "Model 3 - Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application: Naive Bayes algorithms are another extermely popular classification algorithm in the real world. They are well suited for applications like sentiment analysis, weather prediction, news classification etc. They are simple to understand and the fundamental 'naive' assumptions generalize pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Since they are heavily used in text mining etc. they work well with data containing a high number of predictors. They are also simple to implement and do not require huge data volumes for accurate results. Given the underlying naive assumptions, they are more computationally efficient as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: One big weakness is that if a new category is seen in the testing data, which was not seen in the training data, the model will give a probability of zero. There are ways to solve for this however. Another big weakness is the assumption of independence amongst the variables which is usually never true but the algoritm tends to hold up fairly well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choice: I understand the concept behind this algorithm fairly well and our data with a bunch of 1/0 features is similar to how this algorithm keeps tracks of words in sentiment analysis etc. so I hope it will generate a good model.\n",

    "Based on the above charts, it is clear that Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm performed the worst (which was somewhat surprising to me). The accuracy and F-score for this algorithm is consistently lower than the other two, so we can confidently eliminate this model from consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the other two models, AdaBoost Classifier has a better accuracy score and F-score (~83% and ~72% respectively) when the model is run on 100% of the testing dataset when compared to the Decision Tree Classifier (~80% and ~62% respectively). It is also worth noting that the Decision Tree Classifier has a much higher accuracy score and F-score on the training data indicating that the model is probably overfitting the data and does not fit well on the trainign data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these results, AdaBoost is going to be our final model. This model takes almost 4x the time a Decision Tree Classifier takes but the predictive power gains are worth the extra time investment here. Moreover, all models take the same time for predicting and only building the model takes longer for Ada Boost."

    "#### Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model of choice for the purpose of classifying individuals making more than 50K is AdaBoost Classifier. It is an extremely powerful classifier algorithm and belongs to a group of models called the Ensemble models. What this means is that the model aggregates outputs/results from several smaller algorithms and produces a result that is much more accurate than each of the individual algorithms. An easier way to think about this - if you ask a question to one of your friends, it is possible you are seeing a biased or incorrect response. However if you ask all of your friends, you might notice a majority of them giving the same answer and hence you can be more confident with the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will split the data into training and testing samples. We will build the AdaBoost Classifier on the training data by using all the features such as age, gender, education levels etc. as independent variables with the goal of predicting our dependent variable - salary >50K or not. Once this model is built, we will run it against the testing data and see if the model is able to predict >50K earning individuals accurarely. \n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",

    "Education level matters a lot too, for example, people with a Master's or Bachelor's degree might be more willing to donate money to good causes and generally draw a higher salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital gain indicates individuals who have money working for them and they are mostly going to be sitting on enough cash to generate side income. This means they are probably making a higher salary to support their daily needs plus find money for investment purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Age might also be a good predictor because in general, you earn more as you grow in your career, get more experience etc. So I think age might be positively correlated with salary. \n",
    "\n",

    "Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \\$50,000.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Firstly, I am really stoked to see such a cool chart that clearly highlights the top predictors in our model! Pretty neat!\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the top 5 predictors from the model in order ('capital loss', 'age', 'capital gain', 'hours-per-week' and 'education-num') and our initial guess in order ('occupation', 'education', 'capital gain', 'age', and 'hours-per-week'), we can see that out initial guess was not too far away from the truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, two major changes - (1) 'capital-loss' is the strongest predictor according to the model but I had not picked that. But I think it makes sense given that it carries the opposite  meaning of 'capital-gain' but both gain/loss would indicate high income earners that generally do tradign etc. (2) I also thought 'occupation' would be a strong predictor but turns out it is not in the top 5 list."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "\n",
    "As expected, training the AdaBoost Classifier on the reduced 5-feature set brought down the accuracy/F-score compared to the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy went from 86.64% to 84.26% (~2% drop)\n",
    "- F-score from 74.32% to 70.44% (~4% drop) \n",
    "\n",
    "The drop is not terrible but we are sacrificing our predictive power overall. However, the model ran much faster than the full model and this output is going to be much more easier to explain/sell to stakeholders. So for those reasons, I would be ok in suggesting the reduced feature model to Charity ML but it is equally important to quantify the difference between the two options and provide Charity ML with the necessary details to be confident in their choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the 6th predictor (Education Bachelors) is almost as strong as the 5th predictor and from the 7th predictor onwards, the feature importance drops significantly. So a model with the top 6 features might be a good middle ground."
